# thesis-linguistics-crypto-language
This is a language that uses a different and agreed upon set of characters to pass data using “looks like” logic.

All words are encoded so
HELLO might be H3110 instead 
SLEEP might be S113P instead 
etc.

A Linguistic Underground Crypto Language: my computer science linguistics thesis

I have invented a new language to allow all content creators to communicate in a new layer in data.

The language is only readable by a human.

All characters are random and all words are random.

You can try to contain the random variability of the characters to keep or store memory.

The purpose of “the underground language” is to provide a new data layer for a place where the art and the message exceed the language boundaries that divide us.

A simple tool could output our new crypto language from our own into it.

Every major social media company could add support for our new language; once, it takes over their normal data systems.
